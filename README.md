# Iterative_Volterra_Propagator
Volterra integral equations of the second kind take the form
$$f(t) = g(t) + \int_{t_0}^t K(t,s) f(s) ds \hspace{1cm} t_0 \le t \le t_f$$
 for two functions $f$ and $g$ and an integral kernel $K$. Studied first by Liouville \cite{Liouville1837} and later Volterra \cite{Volterra_Vito}, these equations arise in a variety of disciplines, including material science (linear viscoelasticity equations) and probability (the renewal equation). More generally, any first order differential equation can be converted to a Volterra integral equation by integrating. Given an inhomogeneity, $g$ and and integral kernel, $K$, the equations are solved for the unknown, $f$. 
 
 Numerical approaches to these problems have been developed for several decades and are the subject of numerous papers. Early approaches focused on applying a quadrature to the integral in the equation, beginning with the simple trapezoidal rule and generalizing    to more complicated quadrature rules. For an in-depth survey of these techniques as well as a discussion of analytic solutions to (\ref{volterra}), see work of Brunner and van der Houwen \cite{Brunner1986TheNS}. Recent approaches make use of more complicated mathematical machinery,  including interpolation \cite{TAHMASBI2008547}, block methods \cite{article}, and homotopy theory \cite{CHU2022127304}.
 
In this paper, we present a new iterative method for solving Volterra equations based on Lagrange interpolation. In sections two and three, we discuss the numerical details of the method and demonstrate its utility on a handful of toy problems. In the remainder of the paper, we consider in depth the application of our method to the time dependent Schr√¥dinger equation, illustrating its ability to achieve highly accurate results on a number of physical problems.
